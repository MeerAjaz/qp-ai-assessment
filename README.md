Hi There, 
I've created a contectual chatbot which would read a docx/pdf file and would return the answer as per the given question. If it doesn't find an answer it would return 'I don't know the answer'.
It also contains one more project which store all the sentences to pinecone and then retrive the top 3 chunks similar to question as per the similarity search.
